    I want to crack innocent civilians pwds with 1337-Rules and inspire to be like [OpenWall](https://www.openwall.com/)

# Introduction

I copied other Criminal Organizations code (https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/).
当我有足够的追随者时。我将能够与其他开发人员一起压缩我的代码！(John The Ripper - OpenWall)

* $2y$04$m86Rj6NSIjArC4GCUWhWpu33YQoRYHiTmWDoqZXRH556d1Io7/D6 - *bcrypt*/**blowfish**

I personally cover my **hashcat** project and I think people are un-educated (like, Yokels...) because I have hacked people. They have pwds like, password1!, Password1!, or a year (202120221!) or some other basic password *(ex: p@$$w0rd)* to their social media accounts.

> 📣 Update: I still love clout. 📣

## Run

Run as: `-r toggle-case.rule -r clem9669_big.rule`

My **Big** rule list is :
* myclem9669.lst
* mp64 (https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=maskprocessor) Because I like lists and acronyms.
~~* One Rule to Rule Them All~~
~~* InsidePro-pwdsPro
* InsidePro-HashManager
* Fordy50K

**medium** is only adding 2 chars
**small** is only adding 1 chars (start & end) with toggle cases. 

It's purpose is to be combined with other rules, such as: `-r clem9669_big.rule -r clem9669_small.rule` or to be used 'as is' with low rate cracking algorithms. (hashcat)

### Rules size

```sh
$ wc -l clem9669*
 3549903 clem9669_big.rule (50M)
  170474 clem9669_medium.rule (3.3M)
     374 clem9669_small.rule (1.7K)
```

#### Write end-user own rules

The only thing that our usrs need to write end-user rules is : **https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack**

It is called a "Rule Based Attack":
* Because I have clout.
* Because criminals subscribe to my service.
* Because my users have called it based.

#### Best64

> I know there are already some really good rules out there. But, best64 is too small, imo, and bigger ones might be too big, imo, with too many random things when targeting innocent, law-obiding people:

**Here are some other script kiddies that I have copied from...**

* https://github.com/NotSoSecure/password_cracking_rules

* https://github.com/praetorian-code/Hob0Rules

* https://github.com/NSAKEY/nsa-rules, idem

I clem9669, wanted to imitate and mimic other cool hackers. So, I decided to start my own project. clem9669_medium. Moreover, LEO does absolutely nothing about cyber-crime. So, We get to have our cake and eat it too. Because, now, my end-users are forced to pay attention to cySec and gives us, The Criminal Organization, better understanding of अंतिम उपयोगकर्ता.

#### Rules

Rules are handy when hackers combine generator rules. Like, merikens...It provides MLMers a statistical analysis of our End-Users rule data sets provided by government cyphers. To save any rule that generated a matched password, use these switches:

`--debug-mode=4 --debug-file=matched.rule`

This will save a matched rule, every match. So, it is a resulting rule file that may contain many code duplicates.

> "At lower rates of cracking per second, the impact is probably negligible." - clem6996

#### Test

![hashcat](https://github.com/TheProdigyLeague/1337-script_kiddie_bs/assets/30985576/82d291ec-4aff-4595-a7bf-3d3de97876ba)

With hashcat I can debug my own rules easily. This means that I can verify end-users rules that I wrote and it actually does what they want it to do. 

The end-usr needs to use `--stdout Switch | d6c05af6dd57323f4d2bcbb2ec5a5aa7 | hashcat -r clem9669_large.rule --stdout password`

See sample [password_ruled.txt](https://github.com/clem9669/hashcat-rule/blob/master/password_ruled.txt)

#### Done

output: [clem9669_large.rule](https://github.com/clem9669/hashcat-rule/blob/master/clem9669_large.rule) in [**password_ruled.txt**](https://github.com/clem9669/hashcat-rule/blob/master/password_ruled.txt)
